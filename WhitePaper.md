# $SHAK Token - A Binance Token White Paper

## What is https://shakeswap.finance , $SHAK token, TITAN Parachain.

$SHAK token is a Binance Token (BEP-20) used on the USA based/created ShakeSwap.finance decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. Usused for swapping BEP-20 tokens running on the Binance BSC Mainnet blockchain. Forked/Modified from Pancakeswap Contracts, ShakeSwap delivers the same Defi (Decentralized Finance) functions as Uniswap or SushiSwap.

The ShakeSwap exchange doesn’t use order books like traditional exchanges. Instead, it uses an automated market maker (AMM) model which matches buy and sell orders directly with others in a liquidity pool. User deposits maintain liquidity pools. By providing liquidity to such a pool, users can earn trading fees and liquidity provider (LP) tokens. LP tokes are redeemable for the initial capital deposited, plus any fees earned, minus any impermanent loss. Furthermore, LP tokens can then be staked, farmed, and traded.

ShakeSwap utilizes a yield farming model with a range of new features that provide an all-in-one yield optimization platform built around the ShakeSwap token ($SHAK). ShakeSwap benefits from the security of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and PancakeSwap code that provides an all-in-one yield optimization platform. 

## How to Use ShakeSwap and the SHAK Token
ShakeSwap makes yield farming simple and fun. To use ShakeSwap, you’ll first need to connect your MetaMask browser wallet, Trust Wallet, Binance Wallet, or WalletConnect. Although MetaMask is an Ethereum wallet, the design of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) works in a way that makes decentralized applications (dApps) interoperable with Ethereum wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Binance Wallets. Add BSC Mainnet through Settings to set up your wallet/connection to ShakeSwap.Finance to start Yield Farming and Exchange.

if you’re familiar with the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) then ShakeSwap should be straightforward. The ‘exchange’ section is used for token swaps, while the ‘pools’ section is where fees are earned for liquidity provision. Finally, the ‘farming’ section is where the yield farming takes place.

To farm the ShakeSwap token (SHAK), you’ll need to add liquidity to the ShakeSwap exchange pool. After selecting the token pair you wish to deposit, you can begin farming SHAK tokens. As with the movement of ERC-20 tokens in the Metamask wallet, withdrawals must be approved for BEP-20 tokens before PanckeSwap can withdraw them on your behalf. From here, you'll be prompted with a popup displaying the transaction amount and any fees. Then, to stake SHAK, you’ll need to transfer some Binance Coin (BNB) to your Binance Smart Chain (BSC) BEP-20 address for future transaction fees.

Upon the confirmation of your transaction, select how much you want to stake, and confirm the transaction. You can check at any point to see how much SHAK rewards you have earned and harvest any newly awarded tokens. This means SHAK tokens can then be staked to earn more SHAK! Harves

## ShakeSwap Functionality:

### Yield Farming
As an early adopter of smart contracts, the network effect of the Ethereum blockchain gave rise to hundreds of decentralized applications (dApps) and yield farming protocols.

Since then, advancements in the blockchain industry and DeFi have facilitated improved security measures by allowing the coming together of centralized finance (CeFi), and decentralized finance (DeFi). A great example of this is Binance Smart Chain. Binance Smart Chain is an ecosystem of decentralized applications that harness the power and security of Binance while offering many of the services that appeal to DeFi users, such as yield farming. 

Yield farming allows users to stake funds in return for staking rewards. Rewards can be compounded and used across multiple protocols, allowing users to grow yield by chasing the highest interest rates across various parts of the DeFi ecosystem.

Services for yield optimization are now a common feature among many centralized crypto platforms. However, it was DeFi that truly popularized the idea of maximizing yield in crypto. Decentralized applications (dApps) have furthered the development and adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. DeFi Pulse is a website that displays the current rankings and analytics of DeFi protocols. According to DeFi Pulse, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has grown from around $1 billion to over $34 billion in less than a year.


### Providing Liquidity to PancakeSwap
PancakeSwap liquidity provider (LP) tokens are suitably named ‘FLIP’ tokens. FLIP tokens come in different varieties depending upon the token pair provided to a pool. PancakeSwap farmers can lock up their LP tokens and earn further rewards in the process. 

### Yield Pools
The pools section is where fees are earned for liquidity provision. Use the Harvest function to capture rewards from CAKE, BNB, Dogecoin, and many more.
Anyone that provides liquidity to ShakeeSwap pools will receive ‘FLIP’ liquidity provider (LP) tokens along with any trading fees accrued. When using ShakeSwap, traders pay a 0.2% fee. Of this fee, 0.17% is allocated to liquidity providers (LPs) while the remaining 0.03% are burned by ShakeSwap Treasury.

### Trade
Trade/Exchange Bitcoin/Ethereum and all the Binance Tokens including Cake, BNB, and tokenized assets including Tesla, Google, and Netflix shares.


### NFT Marketplace
A marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is scheduled to be deploed Q3 2021.

# Configuration with Polkadot Parachain "TITAN"
Shakeswap.finance and the $SHAKtoken will be utilized in the Titan Parachain being developed on the Polkadot framework. Proceeds from shakeswap.finance will be used to stake a Parachain on the Polkadot network. Currenty project utilization includes storing Powerwall Engery metrics on the Titan Parachain.
